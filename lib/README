# Bank

An app that allows you to deposit amounts, withdraw amounts, and print a statement of your transactions.

##Â Structure

Since the requirements  are for just one account, it only has one bank account class that can do basic functions.

## Setup

To run the app:

```
$ git clone [REPO]
$ cd bank
$ irb
$ require_relative './lib/bank_account'
```

## Example

Inside IRB:

```
$ bank_account = BankAccount.new
$ bank_account.deposit(500)
$ bank_account.withdraw(200)
$ bank_account.print_statement
```

## Testing

To test the app:

```
$ rspec
```
